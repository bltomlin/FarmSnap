# FarmSnap
## A platform where farmers can sell their vegetables directly to buyers.

This platform would allow farmers to upload images of their produce, and buyers can see what's available before placing an order. We want to ensure that only images of certain vegetables make it to our site and that the images are of high quality. 

## We will be utilizing the various cloud services:
### AWS IAM for security;
### Amazon S3 to store images;
### Amazon Rekognition to analyze images;
### AWS Lambda to link the services;
### AWS SDK for Python to interact with cloud services programmatically;
### Amazon SQS to send the results back to our application.
